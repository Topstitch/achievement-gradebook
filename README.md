# Achievement Tracker

Instead of the traditional weighted letter grades, students are given points based on which achievements they choose to complete.  

With this app, a teacher can log in and see a list of all students and their achievements.  They can modify each student's achievements with a simple checkbox form.  The points of a student's achievements are totaled.

Students and parents can log in to see the list of their achievements/their student's achievements.
